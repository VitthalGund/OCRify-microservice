Learn to deploy a FastAPI application into production DigitalOcean App Platform. This is a microservice for our [Try Django 3.2](https://www.codingforentrepreneurs.com/projects/try-django-3-2) project. The goal is to extract any and all text from images using a technique called OCR.

Here's a list of the packages we will use to accomplish this:

- FastAPI
- Tesseract OCR
- pytesseract
- pre-commit
- pytest
- Gunicorn
- Uvicorn
- Requests
- Docker
- and more
